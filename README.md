# Anonymize Data
Sensitive personal data, such as complete names, phone numbers, emails, dates of birth, genders, account balances, last login dates, and country of residence, are included in the data table. This information needs to be handled carefully in the real world to safeguard privacy and comply with laws like the GDPR. Therefore, we decided to anonymize the columns including full name, email address, phone number, date of birth and amount balance. These columns contain direct identifiers that can easily trace back to an individual, making them primary targets for anonymization.
